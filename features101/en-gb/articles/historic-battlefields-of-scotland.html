<p>Scotland has had a turbulent history stretching from Roman times, when in
122 CE the Emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall across the north of
England to mark the northern boundary of the Roman empire, to the late 17th
century when the last pitched battle on British soil was fought at Culloden
in 1746.</p>
