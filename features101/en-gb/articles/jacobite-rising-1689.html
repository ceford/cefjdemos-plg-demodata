<p>The Jacobite rising of 1689 to 1692 took place primarily in the Scottish
Highlands. Its purpose was to restore James II & VII to the throne, following
his deposition by the November 1688 Glorious Revolution. It was the first of
a series of attempts to restore the House of Stuart that continued into the
late 18th century.</p>

<p>A minor part of the wider European conflict known as the Nine Years' War,
the Scottish revolt was intended to support the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War
in Ireland. Despite Jacobite victory at Killiecrankie in July 1689, their
leader John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee was killed in the final attack.
Combined with limited resources, his death meant the rising never really
threatened the new administration of William II & III and Mary II. Major
military action ended at Cromdale in May 1690, although the Highlands were
not considered pacified until after the Massacre of Glencoe in February 1692.</p>
