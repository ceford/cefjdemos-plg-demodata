<h3>Background</h3>

<p>King Edward I of England invaded Scotland in March 1296 to punish
King John Balliol for his refusal to support English military action in France.
After the sack of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Edward remained in the town for a month,
supervising the strengthening of its defences. On 5 April, he received a
message from King John renouncing the homage he had pledged at the time of his
election as King of Scotland in 1292. </p>

<p>The next objective in Edward's campaign to subjugate Scotland was the Earl
of March's castle at Dunbar, 29 miles (47 km) up the coast from Berwick. </p>

<p>The Earl of March was with the English, but
his wife, Marjory Comyn, sister of the Earl of Buchan, did not share her
husband's political loyalties and allowed her fellow Scots to occupy the castle.
Edward sent one of his chief lieutenants, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey,
John Balliol's own father-in-law, northwards with a strong force of knights to
invest the stronghold. The defenders sent messages to King John, who bivouacked
with the main body of his army at nearby Haddington, asking for urgent
assistance. In response the army, or a large part of it, advanced to the
rescue of Dunbar. John, who was showing even less skill as a commander
than he had as a king, did not accompany it. The campaign of 1296 was now to
enter its final phase.</p>

<h3>The Battle</h3>

<p>There is little evidence to suggest that Dunbar was anything other than an
action between two bodies of mounted men-at-arms (armoured cavalry). Surrey's
force seems to have comprised one formation (out of four) of the English
cavalry; the Scots force led in part by Comyns probably represented the
greater part of their cavalry element. </p>

<p>The two forces came in sight of each
other on 27 April. The Scots occupied a strong position on some high ground to
the west. To meet them, Surrey's cavalry had to cross a gully intersected by
the Spott Burn. As they did so their ranks broke up, and the Scots, deluded
into thinking the English were leaving the field, abandoned their position in
a disorderly downhill charge, only to find that Surrey's forces had reformed
on Spottsmuir and were advancing in perfect order. </p>

<p>The English routed the
disorganised Scots in a single charge. The action was brief and probably not
very bloody, since the only casualty of any note was a minor Lothian knight,
Sir Patrick Graham, though about 100 Scottish lords, knights and men-at-arms
were taken prisoner. According to one English source over ten thousand Scots
died at the battle of Dunbar, however this is probably a confusion with the
casualties incurred at the storming of Berwick. The survivors fled westwards
to the safety of the Ettrick Forest. </p>

<p>The following day King Edward appeared in
person and Dunbar castle surrendered. Some important prisoners were taken:
John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, and the earls of Atholl, Ross and Menteith,
together with 130 knights and esquires. All were sent into captivity in
England. </p>
