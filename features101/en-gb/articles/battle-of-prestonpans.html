<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The War of the Austrian Succession meant that by early 1745 the bulk of
British forces were committed in Flanders. Encouraged by a French victory at
Fontenoy in April 1745, Charles Edward Stuart sailed for Scotland in July,
hoping to take advantage of the situation. The rebellion was formally launched
at Glenfinnan on 19 August. The Battle of Prestonpans in East Lothian was the
first significant engagement of the Jacobite rising of 1745.</p>

<p>Sir John Cope, government commander in Scotland, was a competent soldier
with between 3,000 and 4,000 troops available, but many were inexperienced
recruits and he was hampered by poor intelligence and advice. Following forays
in the highlands, the troops were loaded onto ships at Aberdeen and began
disembarking at Dunbar on 17&nbsp;September. Charles had entered the
Scottish capital earlier that day and the scene was set for the armies to
meet at Prestonpans, midway between Edinburgh and Dunbar.</p>

<h3>The Battle</h3>

<p>The government troops were initially deployed to face south, overlooking a
marshy area. The Jacobite army marched east, passing to the south of Cope's
army, and then turned north to attack from the east. The inexperienced
government troops broke in the face of a Highland charge, this phase of the
battle lasting less than thirty minutes. Cope escaped and reached
Berwick-upon-Tweed the next day with 450 survivors.</p>

<p>The Jacobite victory was a huge boost to morale, and established the
revolt as a serious threat to the British government. </p>
