<p>The Jacobite rising of 1745 was an attempt by Charles Edward Stuart to
regain the British throne for his father, James Francis Edward Stuart.
It took place during the War of the Austrian Succession, when the bulk of the
British Army was fighting in mainland Europe, and proved to be the last in a
series of revolts that began in March 1689, with major outbreaks in
1715 and 1719. </p>

<p>Charles launched the rebellion on 19 August 1745 at Glenfinnan in the
Scottish Highlands, capturing Edinburgh and winning the Battle of Prestonpans
in September. At a council in October, the Scots agreed to invade England after
Charles assured them of substantial support from English Jacobites and a
simultaneous French landing in Southern England. On that basis, the Jacobite
army entered England in early November, but neither of these assurances proved
accurate. On reaching Derby on 4 December, they halted to discuss future
strategy.</p>

<p>Similar discussions had taken place at Carlisle, Preston, and Manchester
and many felt they had gone too far already. The invasion route had been
selected to cross areas considered strongly Jacobite in sympathy, but the
promised English support failed to materialise. With several government
armies marching on their position, they were outnumbered and in danger of
being cut off. </p>

<p>The decision to retreat was supported by the vast majority, but caused an
irretrievable split between Charles and his Scots supporters. Despite
victory at Falkirk Muir in January 1746, defeat at Culloden in April ended
the rebellion. Charles escaped to France, but was unable to win support for
another attempt, and died in Rome in 1788. </p>
