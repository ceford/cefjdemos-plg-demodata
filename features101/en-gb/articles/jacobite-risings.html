<p>Jacobitism was a political ideology strongest in Ireland, the Western
Scottish Highlands, Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. Pockets of support were also
present in Wales, Northern England, the West Midlands and South West England.
Risings that led to battles began in 1689, 1715, 1719 and 1745. The battle of
Culloden on 16 April 1746 was the last large scale pitched battle fought on
British soil.</p>

<p>Jacobitism petered out after the death of Charles Edward Stuart (Bonnie
Prince Charlie) in Rome in January 1788. </p>
