<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In April 1296 an English army defeated a Scottish army at the Battle of
Dunbar. The Scottish King John Balliol surrendered to King Edward I of England
at Brechin on 10 July, and the Scottish landholders were made to acknowledge
Edward's overlordship.</p>

<p>In 1297, Andrew Moray initiated a revolt in northern Scotland and by the
late summer, controlled Urquhart, Inverness, Elgin, Banff and Aberdeen. William
Wallace joined Moray in September near Dundee, and they marched to Stirling,
which was <em>traditionally regarded as the key to Scotland</em>. Meanwhile,
the English army had arrived at Stirling by 9 September 1297. By then, Moray
and Wallace had already occupied Abbey Craig, a hill to the north of
Stirling. </p>

<h3>The Battle</h3>

<p>The Earl of Surrey, who led the English, was concerned with the number of
Scots he faced, separated by a long causeway and narrow, wooden bridge, over
the River Forth near Stirling Castle. Determining that he would be at a
tactical disadvantage if he attempted to take his main force across there,
he delayed crossing for several days to allow for negotiations and to
reconnoiter the area. On 11 September, Surrey had sent emissaries to the Scots.
According to Walter of Guisborough, Wallace reputedly responded with:
<em>We are not here to make peace but to do battle to defend ourselves and
liberate our kingdom. Let them come on and we shall prove this to their very
beards.</em> </p>

<p>The Scots dominated the soft flat ground north of the river Forth. The
English force of knights, bowmen and foot soldiers camped south of the river.
Between the two armies a small bridge offered the safest river crossing but
was broad enough to let only two horsemen cross abreast.</p>

<p>Wallace and Moray waited until as many of the enemy had come over as they
believed they could overcome (possibly about 2,000). The attack was ordered
and the Scots spearmen came down from the high ground in rapid advance,
fended off a charge by the English heavy cavalry and then counterattacked the
English infantry. They gained control of the near side of the bridge and cut
off the chance of English reinforcements to cross. Caught on the low ground
in the loop of the river with no chance of relief or of retreat, most of the
outnumbered English on the attacked side were probably killed. A few hundred
may have escaped by swimming across the river. </p>

<p>Surrey, who was left with a small contingent of archers, had stayed south
of the river and was still in a strong position. The bulk of his army remained
intact and he could have held the line of the Forth, denying the Scots a
passage to the south, but his confidence was gone. He ordered the bridge to
be destroyed, retreated towards Berwick, leaving the garrison at Stirling
Castle isolated and abandoning the Lowlands to the rebels. </p>

<p>The contemporary English chronicler Walter of Guisborough recorded the
English losses in the battle as 100 cavalry and 5,000 infantry killed. Scottish
casualties in the battle are unrecorded, with the exception of Andrew Moray,
who was mortally wounded during the battle, and was dead by November.
The Scots proceeded to raid the south as far as Durham, England. Wallace was
appointed <em>Guardian of the kingdom of Scotland and commander of its
army</em>. Yet, Edward was already planning another invasion of Scotland,
which would lead to the Battle of Falkirk in 1298. </p>
