<p>The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military campaigns in the
late 13th and 14th centuries to protect the independence and sovereignty of the
Kingdom of Scotland which had been threatened by the Kingdom of England.
The wars were part of a great crisis for Scotland, and the period became one
of the most defining times in its history. </p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway, in late September 1290, there
arose a number of claimants to the throne of Scotland. The Guardians of
Scotland were the de facto heads of state until a king was chosen. The
late king, Alexander III of the Canmore line, had been married to Margaret of
England, sister to Edward I, and he was asked to conduct the court proceedings
in the dispute, though not to arbitrate; the decision was to be made by a
jury of 104 "auditors". </p>

<p>John Balliol, a descendant of King David I, was chosen and was inaugurated
at Scone, on St. Andrew's Day, 30 November 1292. Edward I treated Scotland
as a feudal vassal state, claiming contributions toward the cost of the
defence of England. When he demanded military support for his war against
France, the Scots responded by forming an alliance with the French, and
launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle. </p>

<p>The First War (1296–1328) began with the English invasion of Scotland and
ended with the signing of the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton. The Second War
(1332–1357) began with the English-supported invasion by Edward Balliol and the
"Disinherited" and ended with the signing of the Treaty of Berwick. </p>

<p>Notable figures during the Wars of Scottish Independence included several
of the Kings of Scotland such as Alexander III of Scotland, John Balliol,
Robert the Bruce and David II of Scotland, with other prominent figures such
as William Wallace who served as Guardian of Scotland from 1297–1298. Key
figures on the English side include monarchs Edward I, Edward II and Edward III,
as well as the contested King of Scotland, Edward Balliol. </p>
