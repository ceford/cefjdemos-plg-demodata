<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Following the Battle of Dunbar I in 1296, Scotland was in a prolonged
period of political and economic instability. An Anglo-Scottish truce expired
on 30 November 1302 and the English prepared for a fresh invasion of
Scotland.</p>

<hr id="system-readmore">

<p>King Edward I ordered John Segrave, the king's lieutenant in Scotland, to
carry out a reconnaissance before the king himself fought a larger
campaign. This force assembled at Wark on Tweed, 15 miles south of Berwick,
and moved north.

<h3>The Battle</h3>

<p>As the English army advanced through Scotland in another retaliatory campaign
for the Guardians earlier expulsion of Edward I's sheriffs and bailiffs, they
initially met little opposition. The accounts talk of the army being divided up
into three divisions, which entered Roslin in either February or March of 1303.
The divisions were commanded by Sir John Segrave (or John de Segrave),
Ralph Manton and Sir Robert Neville.</p>

<p>It was while in their respective camps that the English divisions were
surprised by an attack led by mounted Scottish knights, led John Comyn
and Simon Fraser. The Scots had ridden overnight from Biggar and attacked
the occupants of the first camp, the survivors of this assault then warning
the occupants of the second camp. The men in the second camp collected their
arms and defended themselves against the Scots who had moved on from their
first target. There was vicious hand to hand combat, in which the English
almost succeeded in gaining the upper hand. However, rallied by their
leaders the Scots renewed their assault and took the camp. No sooner had
this combat ended than the third English division appeared, presumably better
prepared for action than either of the first two. Again with the encouragement
of their leaders the Scots re-entered the fray and to the astonishment of all
won their third victory, though not before putting the survivors of the first
two battles to the sword and taking their horses.</p>
